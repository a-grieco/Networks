1. PURPOSE
----------
This project uses socket programming to create TCP connections between clients
and a multi-client server. Using this connection, clients will connect to the
server, send the server a username, and the server will respond with the finger
service data for that username.

2. BASIC ASSUMPTIONS AND INFORMATION
------------------------------------
SERVER:
Port Number:    Defaults to 10042 unless specified by user.
                A Port Number defined by the user must be between 10000 and
                13000 (inclusive) or it will be rejected.
# Connections:  Maximum of 10 client connections allowed simultaneously.
Client Request: The username received from a client may not exceed 100
                characters; otherwise the request is rejected.
Display Status: Set DISPLAY_STATUS to true to display the Port Number on which
                the Server is running and client requests as they are received.
                If turned off, server only displays listening status when socket
                binding is complete.
CLIENT:
Console Argument: Must match the form <username@hostname:server_port>
                Username must be at least 1 and no more than 100 characters long
                Hostname and Server Port must match the fingerserver

3. COMPILING AND RUNNING THE PROGRAM
------------------------------------
Use "make" to compile the client and server into executables:
  fingerclient and fingerserver
Note: "make clean" will remove executables.

Start the SERVER on Port Number 10042 (automatically selected) by typing
into the command line:
    ./fingerserver
Or start the SERVER on a specified Port Number by typing into the command line:
    ./fingerserver <port_number>
          example: ./fingerserver 10042
Note: Port number must be between 10000 and 13000 (inclusive)

After the server is running, in a new console (or multiple consoles), run the
CLIENT program by typing into the command line:
    ./fingerclient <username@hostname:server_port>
          example:  ./fingerclient griecoa1@cs1.seattleu.edu:10042
